As described in the brief I have built a frontend UI using React, Typescript.

The UI was generated using Vite.

I have used Redux to manage and sort results.

I have written tests using Vitest and react-testing-library.

I would further test the components and I would implement a `Search` on the homepage if this was a live project.

Please use `test:ui` to run test suite
